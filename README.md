PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project involved designing and implementing a robust data pipeline using Databricks, aimed
at consolidating data from google storage and organizing it within a Medallion Architecture. The
primary goal was to create a scalable, efficient, and reliable data processing system that could
handle batch streams, ultimately delivering high-quality, actionable insights for analytics and
reporting. This architecture ensured that raw data could be ingested, cleansed, and transformed
into a business-ready format, providing the organization with a streamlined and accessible data
flow.
Objectives and Goals
The key objective of implementing the Medallion Architecture was to improve the overall data
management process by structuring the data into three distinct layers—Bronze, Silver, and
Gold—each serving a specific purpose. The Bronze layer focused on capturing and storing raw
data from google cloud storage in its native format, ensuring that all incoming data was
preserved and easily accessible for future processing. The Silver layer aimed at cleansing,
transforming, and enriching the raw data, standardizing it across all sources to create a unified
view. Finally, the Gold layer aggregated and refined the data to produce business-ready
datasets that were optimized for analysis and reporting. The overarching goal was to provide
the organization with a flexible, scalable, and secure data pipeline that enhanced data quality,
improved performance, and supported informed decision-making.
1. Architecture and Design
The project was structured using the Medallion Architecture, a layered approach that organizes
data processing into three distinct stages—Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers—each with a specific
purpose and level of data refinement.
● Bronze Layer (Raw Data): This layer served as the foundational stage, where raw data
was ingested directly from Google cloud storage. The data was stored in its native
format in Delta Lake tables, ensuring that all original information was preserved for
potential reprocessing or auditing. The primary focus of the Bronze layer was to create a
comprehensive and immutable record of all incoming data.
● Silver Layer (Cleaned and Enriched Data): The Silver layer involved cleansing,
transforming, and enriching the raw data from the Bronze layer. Here, data validation
checks were performed, duplicates were removed, and schemas were standardized to
ensure consistency across different data sources. This layer also involved joining and
integrating data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset that was ready for
further analysis. The output of the Silver layer was stored in Delta Lake tables, providing
a more refined and organized view of the data.
● Gold Layer (Aggregated and Business-Ready Data): The final stage of the
architecture, the Gold layer, focused on creating business-ready datasets. This involved
aggregating data, performing complex calculations, and optimizing it for quick queries
and reporting. The Gold layer produced highly refined data that was used directly by
business intelligence tools for analytics and decision-making. The data in this layer was
designed to be easily accessible and tailored to meet specific business needs.
Description of the Data Flow:
The data flow in the project began with the ingestion of raw data into the Bronze layer. Here,
data from Google cloud storage was captured in its original form and stored in Delta Lake
tables. Once ingested, the data moved to the Silver layer, where it underwent a series of
transformations, including cleaning, validation, and enrichment processes. This step ensured
that the data was consistent and of high quality, ready for integration and further processing.
Finally, the transformed data was processed in the Gold layer, where it was aggregated and
optimized to create actionable, business-ready datasets. These datasets were then used in
reporting tools like Power BI, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on
accurate and timely insights.
Tools and Technologies Used:
● Databricks: The primary platform used for developing and orchestrating the data
pipeline, leveraging its powerful data processing capabilities and seamless integration
with Delta Lake.
● Delta Lake: Used as the storage layer for all data in the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers,
providing ACID transaction support, schema enforcement, and data versioning.
● Apache Spark: Utilized within Databricks for processing and transforming large-scale
datasets across the different layers.
● Python/PySpark: The programming languages used to write the ETL processes and
data transformations within Databricks.
● Power BI: The business intelligence tool used to visualize and report on the aggregated
data from the Gold layer, providing stakeholders with actionable insights.
2. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
Sources of Raw Data:
The Bronze layer was designed to ingest raw data from multiple diverse sources to create a
comprehensive repository of all incoming information.
● Cloud Storage: Data was also pulled from Google Storage, where various files, logs,
and unstructured data were stored.
Methods and Tools Used for Data Ingestion:
● Azure Databricks: Databricks played a central role in the data ingestion process,
particularly for processing and ingesting large datasets and real-time streams.
Databricks was integrated with Delta Lake to store the raw data in a scalable and reliable
manner.
Description of Data Types and Formats Ingested:
● Structured Data: Data from cloud storage came in the form of tables with defined
schemas, including integer, string, date, and other data types.
Data Processing and Transformation (Silver Layer):
● Data Validation: The first step involved validating the data to ensure it met the required
quality standards. This included checking for missing values, validating data types, and
ensuring that records adhered to predefined schemas.
● Duplicate Removal: To maintain data integrity, duplicates were identified and removed
from the dataset. This was particularly important for transactional data and log files,
where duplicate entries could skew analysis results.
● Standardization: Data from different sources often had varying formats. Standardization
processes were applied to ensure consistency across datasets, such as converting date
formats, normalizing text fields, and aligning categorical data.
● Data Enrichment: The data was enriched by integrating additional information from
other datasets or external sources. This included augmenting sales data with
demographic information or adding geographical data to transaction records.
ETL processes used and the tools involved:
● Azure Databricks: Azure Databricks was the primary platform used for executing ETL
processes. It provided the computational power needed to handle large-scale data
transformations and offered seamless integration with Delta Lake for storage.
● Apache Spark: Spark, running within Databricks, was used for parallel processing of
large datasets. It enabled efficient data transformations, including filtering, aggregating,
and joining data from multiple sources.
● PySpark: PySpark scripts were written to define and automate the transformation logic.
These scripts performed tasks such as data validation, cleaning, and enrichment,
leveraging the full power of Spark’s distributed processing capabilities.
Key Transformations and Their Purposes:
● Data Filtering: One of the initial transformations involved filtering out irrelevant or
corrupted data, such as removing records with missing essential fields or filtering out
events that were not of interest for further analysis. This reduced the dataset size and
focused the analysis on high-quality, relevant data.
● Joins and Merges: Data from different sources was often joined or merged to create a
unified view. For example, transaction records were joined with customer data to provide
context for each transaction, or sales data was merged with inventory data to provide
insights into stock levels.
● Aggregations: Key metrics, such as total sales, average order value, or customer
lifetime value, were calculated through aggregation processes. These transformations
summarized the data, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns in subsequent
steps.
● Schema Enforcement: As part of standardizing the data, schema enforcement ensured
that all records adhered to a consistent format. This included defining data types for
each field and ensuring that the data conformed to these definitions, which helped
maintain data integrity and facilitated more straightforward querying and analysis.
Data Refinement and Aggregation (Gold Layer)
In the Gold layer, the data underwent additional processing to apply business logic and create
aggregated datasets that were ready for direct use in reporting and analysis. This layer focused
on refining the already cleansed and standardized data from the Silver layer, tailoring it to meet
specific business requirements. The transformations included complex calculations, such as
revenue and profit margins, as well as aggregations like sales by region, customer
segmentation, and time-series analyses. The goal was to distil the data into high-value,
business-ready insights that could be used by decision-makers to drive strategic initiatives.
Methods Used for Creating Refined Datasets:
● Aggregation Functions: Using Apache Spark within Databricks, I applied various
aggregation functions to the data, such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and GROUP BY to
consolidate data into meaningful summaries. For example, sales data was aggregated
by product, region, and time period to provide insights into performance trends.
● Window Functions: Window functions were used to perform calculations across a set of
table rows that are related to the current row, such as calculating moving averages or
ranking customers by their total purchases. This allowed for more complex analytical
queries that provided deeper insights into the data.
● Business Logic Implementation: Custom business logic was applied to create derived
metrics and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). For example, customer lifetime value
(CLTV) was calculated by considering purchase history and frequency, while profitability
analyses were conducted by incorporating cost data.
● Data Partitioning: To improve query performance and manage large datasets efficiently,
I implemented data partitioning based on key dimensions such as date or region. This
allowed for quicker access to relevant data subsets and optimized the storage and
retrieval processes.
Data models and schema design:
● Star Schema: In many cases, I employed a star schema design, where a central fact
table (e.g., sales transactions) was surrounded by related dimension tables (e.g.,
products, customers, time). This schema design allowed for efficient querying and
reporting, particularly in business intelligence tools like Power BI.
● Fact and Dimension Tables: The data was organized into fact tables that stored
quantitative data for analysis (e.g., sales amounts, quantities) and dimension tables that
provided context to these facts (e.g., customer details, product information). This
separation of concerns made it easier to perform complex queries and generate reports.
● Schema Evolution: I also accounted for schema evolution, ensuring that the data
models could adapt as new business requirements emerged. This involved designing the
schema to accommodate additional fields or new data sources without disrupting
existing processes or data integrity.
3. Storage and Management
● Bronze Layer (Raw Data): The Bronze layer stored the raw data in its native format
using Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). Delta Lake provided the
flexibility to ingest a wide variety of data types (structured, semi-structured, and
unstructured) while ensuring that all incoming data was captured and preserved. Azure
Data Lake Storage offered scalable and cost-effective storage that could handle the
large volumes of raw data generated by multiple sources.
● Silver Layer (Cleaned b and Enriched Data): For the Silver layer, where data was
cleaned and transformed, Delta Lake continued to be the storage solution, still
leveraging Azure Data Lake Storage. The refined data was stored in Delta format,
which allowed for efficient querying and processing while maintaining the flexibility to
handle complex transformations. The Silver layer required more structured storage, as
the data was standardized and integrated across various sources.
● Gold Layer (Aggregated and Business-Ready Data): The Gold layer, which held the
final, business-ready datasets, also utilized Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake Storage.
The datasets were optimized for fast access and query performance, making them ideal
for use with business intelligence tools. The Delta format was particularly beneficial here,
as it supported advanced features like indexing and caching, which were crucial for
handling large-scale data aggregation and providing real-time insights.
How Data is Partitioned, Versioned, and Managed Across Layers:
● Partitioning:
○ To optimize query performance and manage large datasets efficiently, data was
partitioned based on key dimensions such as date, region, or product category.
Partitioning in Delta Lake allowed for quicker access to specific subsets of data,
reducing the amount of data scanned during queries and improving overall
processing speed.
○ For example, sales data might be partitioned by date (e.g., by year, month, and
day), enabling fast retrieval of records for specific time periods without scanning
the entire dataset.
● Versioning:
○ Delta Lake’s built-in versioning capabilities were leveraged across all layers to
maintain historical versions of the data. This enabled time travel queries, allowing
the team to access and analyze previous versions of the data for auditing,
rollback, or comparison purposes.
○ Versioning was particularly useful in the Silver and Gold layers, where
transformations and aggregations were applied. It ensured that any changes to
the data could be tracked, and previous states could be restored if necessary.
● Management:
○ Data management across the layers was facilitated by Delta Lake's support for
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data
integrity and reliability. This was crucial for managing the complexity of the
pipeline, especially as data was moved from raw ingestion in the Bronze layer to
refined and aggregated forms in the Silver and Gold layers.
○ Data Governance: robust data governance practices were implemented,
including access controls and audit logs, to ensure that data was handled
securely and in compliance with organizational policies. Role-based access
control (RBAC) was used to limit access to sensitive data, ensuring that only
authorized users could view or modify data at different stages of the pipeline.
○ Automated Data Management: Automated jobs and workflows were set up
within Azure Databricks to handle data ingestion, transformation, and
aggregation, ensuring that data was processed and moved through the layers
efficiently. Monitoring tools were also employed to track the performance and
health of the data pipeline, enabling proactive management of resources and
timely intervention in case of any issues.
4. Data Governance and Security
Security Measures Implemented:
To ensure the security of the data throughout the pipeline, a range of robust security measures
were implemented across all layers of the Medallion Architecture:
● Encryption:
○ Data at Rest: All data stored in the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers within Azure
Data Lake Storage was encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.
This ensured that even if unauthorized access to the storage occurred, the data
would remain protected and unreadable without the proper decryption keys.
○ Data in Transit: To protect data during transmission between various
components of the pipeline (e.g., from data sources to Databricks or from
Databricks to Power BI), TLS (Transport Layer Security) was used to encrypt
data in transit. This prevented man-in-the-middle attacks and ensured secure
communication channels.
● Access Control:
○ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to data was tightly controlled
using role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms. Only authorized personnel
were granted access to specific data layers, with permissions based on their role
and responsibilities. For example, data engineers could access raw and
processed data in the Bronze and Silver layers, while business analysts were
provided access only to the aggregated data in the Gold layer.
○ Identity and Access Management (IAM): Azure’s IAM features were used to
manage user identities and control access to resources. Multi-factor
authentication (MFA) was enforced for accessing sensitive data and
administrative functions, adding an extra layer of security.
● Audit Logging and Monitoring:
○ Comprehensive logging and monitoring systems were set up to track all access
and modification activities across the data pipeline. Audit logs captured details
such as who accessed the data, when it was accessed, and what actions were
performed. This was crucial for detecting and responding to potential security
breaches and for meeting compliance requirements.
Data Governance Practices:
● Data Quality Checks:
○ Validation Rules: Automated data validation checks were implemented as part
of the ETL processes in the Silver layer. These checks ensured that data met
predefined quality standards, such as verifying that required fields were
populated, data types were consistent, and values fell within acceptable ranges.
Any data that failed these checks was flagged for review or correction.
○ Data Lineage Tracking: Data lineage was tracked to provide transparency into
the data’s journey from raw ingestion to final output. This involved documenting
every transformation, aggregation, and enrichment step, allowing for easy tracing
of data origins and transformations. This was particularly important for
troubleshooting data issues and ensuring data accuracy.
● Compliance:
○ Regulatory Compliance: The project adhered to industry-specific regulations
and standards, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), depending on the data
being processed. This involved implementing data anonymization and
pseudonymization techniques where required, ensuring that sensitive personal
information was protected.
○ Data Retention Policies: Data retention policies were enforced to comply with
legal and regulatory requirements. Data was retained for a specified period and
then archived or securely deleted as necessary. These policies were integrated
into the data management processes to ensure compliance without manual
intervention.
● Data Cataloging and Metadata Management:
○ A data catalog was maintained to document the metadata associated with all
datasets within the pipeline. This included details such as data source, schema,
data owner, and access permissions. The catalog facilitated data discovery,
governance, and collaboration across teams, ensuring that everyone in the
organization had a clear understanding of the data assets available.
5. Performance Optimization
Techniques Used to Optimize the Performance of the Pipeline:
To ensure that the data pipeline operated efficiently and could handle large volumes of data,
several performance optimization techniques were employed:
● Caching:
○ In-Memory Caching: During data processing, frequently accessed datasets
were cached in memory within Apache Spark. This significantly reduced the time
required to perform repetitive operations on the same data, such as joins or
aggregations, by avoiding the need to re-read data from disk repeatedly. This
was particularly useful in the Silver and Gold layers, where iterative
transformations and calculations were common.
● Data Partitioning:
○ Partitioning by Key Dimensions: Data was partitioned based on key
dimensions such as date, region, or customer ID. This allowed Spark to process
data more efficiently by narrowing down the data it needed to scan for specific
queries. For example, partitioning sales data by date enabled quick access to
data for specific time periods without having to read the entire dataset.
○ Optimized Storage: Partitioning also helped to optimize storage usage, as each
partition could be stored as a separate file or set of files in Delta Lake. This
minimized data retrieval times and improved the overall performance of query
execution.
● Delta Lake Optimization:
○ Data Skipping: Delta Lake’s data skipping feature was used to enhance query
performance by automatically skipping over irrelevant data blocks based on
query predicates. This reduced the amount of data that needed to be read during
query execution, leading to faster response times.
○ Z-Ordering: To further optimize query performance, Z-Ordering was applied to
certain datasets. Z-Ordering is a data layout optimization technique that
organizes data on disk to improve the efficiency of query execution, especially for
columns that are commonly filtered or queried together.
● Parallel Processing:
○ Spark’s Distributed Computing: Apache Spark’s distributed computing
capabilities were leveraged to parallelize data processing tasks across multiple
nodes. This allowed the pipeline to handle large-scale data processing tasks
efficiently, ensuring that even complex transformations and aggregations could
be completed in a timely manner.
Monitoring and Scaling Considerations:
● Real-Time Monitoring:
○ Databricks Monitoring Tools: The performance of the data pipeline was
continuously monitored using Databricks’ built-in monitoring tools, which provided
insights into job execution times, resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks.
Alerts were configured to notify the team of any performance degradation or
failures, allowing for quick resolution.
○ Spark UI: The Spark UI was regularly used to monitor the performance of
individual Spark jobs, track stages and tasks, and identify areas where
performance could be optimized further. This included analyzing task execution
times, shuffle operations, and data skew.
● Auto-Scaling:
○ Cluster Auto-Scaling: The Databricks clusters were configured with auto-scaling
capabilities, allowing them to automatically adjust the number of nodes based on
the workload. During periods of high demand, such as during large batch
processing jobs, the cluster could scale up to handle the increased load, and
then scale down during off-peak times to save costs.
○ Resource Management: Resource allocation was carefully managed to ensure
that critical tasks received the necessary computational power while maintaining
cost efficiency. This involved setting up different cluster configurations for various
stages of the pipeline, ensuring that each stage had the optimal resources
without overspending.
● Performance Tuning:
○ Query Optimization: Regular performance tuning was conducted to optimize
SQL queries and Spark operations. This included rewriting complex queries to
reduce execution time, minimizing data shuffles, and optimizing join strategies.
○ Job Scheduling: ETL jobs were scheduled during off-peak hours where
possible, reducing the competition for resources and ensuring that time-sensitive
processing tasks could be completed without delays.
6. Visualization and Reporting
● Direct Query and Import Mode: Depending on the reporting needs, both Direct Query
and Import modes were utilized in Power BI. Direct Query allowed users to interact with
the most up-to-date data directly from the Delta Lake, making it ideal for real-time
analytics. For reports that didn’t require real-time updates, data was imported into Power
BI, which improved performance and responsiveness when working with large datasets.
● Data Modeling in Power BI: To optimize the performance and usability of the reports,
data models were created within Power BI, utilizing relationships between fact and
dimension tables that were organized in a star schema. This allowed for efficient
querying and intuitive exploration of the data by business users.

○ As data privacy concerns continue to grow, implementing more advanced data
masking techniques could further enhance the pipeline’s security. This could
include dynamic data masking, which allows for different levels of data visibility
based on user roles, ensuring that sensitive information is protected even during
analytics and reporting. Additionally, integrating privacy-preserving techniques
like differential privacy could allow for the analysis of sensitive datasets while
minimizing the risk of exposing individual data points.
5. Incorporation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Capabilities:
○ For organizations dealing with large volumes of unstructured text data,
incorporating NLP capabilities into the pipeline could unlock new insights. This
could involve adding modules for sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and text
summarization, enabling the organization to extract valuable information from
customer feedback, social media, and other text-based sources.
